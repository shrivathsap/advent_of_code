Day 04 - Printing Department

I'm not very satisfied with my solution and I'm sure there are ways to make it faster. This is a grid problem, there's a grid with empty sites `.` and paper rolls `@`, and a roll is accessible if it is surround by fewer than 4 rolls in the 8 adjacent cells. For part one, we should compute the number of accessible rolls. For part two, we should remove accessible rolls (thus creating new accessible rolls) until we can no longer remove them and find out how many rolls were removed.

As with other grid problems, a `neighbours` function finds the adjacent neighbours. `accessible` function simply checks the neighbours and returns a Boolean. Looping over all the positions in the grid and taking length solves part one. For part two, I wrote a function that removes rolls and creates a new grid, and then repeat this until there are no more accessible rolls. This solution takes about 24 seconds to run, which is quite slow.

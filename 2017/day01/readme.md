Day 01 - Inverse Captcha

This was quite simple, we are given a string like `123123` for example (my input had 2128 characters) and we are to find two sums: the first is where we sum over those digits that agree with the next digit and the second is a sum over those digits that agree with the digit halfway ahead (making sure to wrap around). So, in `1122`, we get a sum of `1+2` for the first `1` and first `2` for the first task and `0` for the second task. In `123123` we get `0` for the first task and `12` for the second task because all the digits match up. A simple list comprehension does the job.
